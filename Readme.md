## Vehicle Detection and Tracking Videos.

Track Vehicles in video. Here is the pipeline, 

- Extract useful features and train a classifier to distinguish between a vehicle and a non vehicle.
- Do a window based search from images of frames of video and detect vehicles on road.
- Deduplicate the multiple identifications, remove false positives and draw boxes around the vehicles.
